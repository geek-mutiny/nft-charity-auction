    "description": "On April 14, 2022, Ukraine inflicted Russia's biggest military defeat at sea in the 21st century. The Ukrainian military launched the warship \"Moskva\" with two Neptune anti-ship missiles. The first Squadron battleship \"Petropavlovsk\" sank after blowing up a mine while leaving Port Arthur harbor on March 31, 1904. Large flagships are not just a military unit in the fleet. They have a powerful national and national symbolic meaning. They clearly represent the strength and power of the country at sea. Accordingly, their loss is very painful.
